MODULE 1: VARIABLES & DATA TYPES - Your First Steps in Python! üêç
====================================================================

Welcome to your first Python module! In this lesson, you'll learn about
variables and data types - the building blocks of all programming.

WHAT ARE VARIABLES?
Variables are like labeled containers that store information. Think of them
as boxes with names on them - you can put different things in each box
and access them later by their name.

PYTHON DATA TYPES WE'LL COVER:
- str (string): Text data like "Hello" or "192.168.1.1"
- int (integer): Whole numbers like 22, 80, 443
- float (decimal): Numbers with decimal points like 3.14, 99.9
- bool (boolean): True or False values
"""

# ============================================================================
# CONCEPT EXPLANATION: Variables and Data Types
# ============================================================================

# STRING EXAMPLES - Text data (always in quotes)
username = "admin"
ip_address = "192.168.1.100"
log_message = "Login successful"

# INTEGER EXAMPLES - Whole numbers (no quotes needed)
port_number = 443
failed_attempts = 5
max_connections = 100

# FLOAT EXAMPLES - Decimal numbers
cpu_usage = 87.5
network_latency = 0.025
security_score = 8.7

# BOOLEAN EXAMPLES - True or False values
firewall_enabled = True
intrusion_detected = False
admin_logged_in = True

# ============================================================================
# HOW THIS APPLIES TO CYBERSECURITY ADMINISTRATION:
# ============================================================================
"""
CYBERSECURITY APPLICATIONS OF VARIABLES:

1. STORING NETWORK INFORMATION:
   - IP addresses, port numbers, network ranges
   - Server names, domain names, MAC addresses

2. TRACKING SECURITY EVENTS:
   - Login attempts, failed passwords, access times
   - Alert levels, threat scores, vulnerability counts

3. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:
   - Security settings, timeout values, thresholds
   - Enable/disable flags for security features

4. LOG ANALYSIS:
   - Error messages, event descriptions, timestamps
   - User actions, system responses, alert notifications

5. AUTOMATION SCRIPTS:
   - Status indicators, process counters, success flags
   - File paths, command parameters, script results

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
A cybersecurity admin might use variables to store:
- current_threat_level = "HIGH"
- suspicious_ip = "203.0.113.42"
- ports_to_scan = [21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443]
- scan_complete = False
"""

# Network Security Variables
suspicious_ip = "203.0.113.42"
blocked_ports = 1337
threat_level = "MEDIUM"
firewall_active = True

PRACTICE: Basic String Variable

# Exercise 2: Create a number variable

PRACTICE: Basic Number Variable

Create a variable named port that stores the number 443.

# TODO: Create port variable


# Exercise 3: Create a boolean variable
"""
PRACTICE: Basic Boolean Variable

Create a variable named is_secure that stores True.
"""
# TODO: Create is_secure variable


# Exercise 4: Create multiple variables
"""
PRACTICE: Multiple Variables

Create these three variables:
- server_name with value "firewall"
- connections with value 25
- online with value True

CYBERSECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM SETUP

You are a cybersecurity administrator setting up a new monitoring system for your organization. 
The system needs to track various pieces of critical infrastructure information.

Your task is to create a data storage system that can hold the following information:
- The username of the primary security administrator: "secladmin"
- The IP address of the main server: "10.0.0.50"
- The SSH port number used for secure connections: 22
- The number of failed login attempts currently recorded: 3
- The system uptime measured in hours: 72.5
- Whether a security patch is required: Yes
- Whether the backup process has completed: No

Create variables named admin_username, server_ip, ssh_port, login_attempts, 
uptime_hours, patch_required, and backup_completed to store this information.

After storing the data, display each piece of information with a descriptive 
label so other administrators can quickly review the system status.

"""
Great job completing Module 1! Here's what you learned:

‚úÖ How to create variables in Python
‚úÖ The four main data types: str, int, float, bool
‚úÖ How variables apply to cybersecurity work
‚úÖ Basic variable naming and assignment

CYBERSECURITY SKILLS GAINED:
- Store network configuration data
- Track security metrics and status
- Manage user and system information
- Create foundation for security automation

NEXT MODULE: 02_operators.py
In the next module, you'll learn about operators - the tools that let you
compare data, perform calculations, and make logical decisions in your
cybersecurity scripts.

Keep up the excellent work! üöÄ
