MODULE 5: LISTS - Managing Collections of Security Data üìã
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 5! You've been using lists in previous modules, but now
you'll master them completely. Lists are essential for cybersecurity work
because you're always dealing with collections: IP addresses, user accounts,
security alerts, port numbers, and more.

WHAT ARE LISTS?
Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items. Think of them
as containers that hold related data together, like a list of authorized
users or a collection of suspicious IP addresses.

LIST OPERATIONS WE'LL COVER:
- Creating and accessing lists
- Adding and removing items
- Searching and sorting lists
- List slicing and manipulation
- Common list methods for security work
"""

# ============================================================================
# HOW THIS APPLIES TO CYBERSECURITY ADMINISTRATION:
# ============================================================================
"""
CYBERSECURITY APPLICATIONS OF LISTS:

1. IP ADDRESS MANAGEMENT:
   - Whitelist: authorized IP addresses
   - Blacklist: known malicious IP addresses
   - Subnet ranges: network segments to monitor
   - DHCP pools: assigned IP addresses

2. USER AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT:
   - User accounts: active, inactive, privileged users
   - Role assignments: admin, user, guest permissions
   - Access logs: login attempts, successful/failed authentications
   - Password policies: complexity requirements, history

3. SECURITY MONITORING:
   - Alert types: critical, high, medium, low priority
   - Event logs: security incidents, system events
   - Threat indicators: IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
   - Vulnerability lists: CVE numbers, CVSS scores

4. NETWORK SECURITY:
   - Open ports: services running on systems
   - Blocked ports: restricted network access
   - Protocol monitoring: HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP traffic
   - Firewall rules: allow/deny lists

5. INCIDENT RESPONSE:
   - Affected systems: compromised hosts and services
   - Evidence collection: files, logs, network captures
   - Response team: assigned personnel and roles
   - Timeline events: chronological incident details

6. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT:
   - Security tools: installed and configured applications
   - Policy settings: security configurations and standards
   - Patch levels: installed updates and missing patches
   - Backup schedules: data protection and recovery plans

# WARM-UP EXERCISES: Practice Using Lists
# ============================================================================

# Exercise 1: Create and print a simple list
"""
PRACTICE: Basic List Creation

Write a function `create_device_list()` that creates and returns a list
called `devices` with three items: "firewall", "router", "switch".
The function should also return the length of this list.
Return both the list and its length as a tuple: (list, length).

# Exercise 2: Add item to list
"""
PRACTICE: Adding to Lists

Write a function `add_user_to_list(users_list, new_user)` that takes a list
of users and a new user string.
It should add the `new_user` to the end of the `users_list` using append().
The function should return the modified list.

# TODO: Implement the function add_user_to_list
def add_user_to_list(users_list, new_user):

# Exercise 3: Remove item from list
"""
PRACTICE: Removing from Lists

Write a function `remove_service_from_list(services_list, service_to_remove)`
that takes a list of services and a service string to remove.
It should remove the `service_to_remove` from the `services_list` using remove().
If the service is not in the list, it should do nothing and return the original list.
The function should return the modified list.

    # Your code here

# Exercise 4: Check if item exists in list
"""
PRACTICE: Checking List Membership

Write a function `check_port_access(allowed_ports_list, port_to_check)`
that takes a list of allowed ports and a port number to check.
It should return True if `port_to_check` is in `allowed_ports_list`,
and False otherwise.

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Asset Management System
# ============================================================================
"""
SECURITY ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You are building a comprehensive security asset management system for your organization.
The system needs to track network devices, user accounts, security alerts, and
vulnerability assessments.

NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TRACKING:
Your network currently has these devices: firewall, router, switch, and server.
The security team is adding a new intrusion detection system and needs to insert
a load balancer between the router and switch (at position 2 of the 0-indexed list,
meaning it will be the third item).

Create a list named network_devices with the initial devices. Then:
1. Add "intrusion_detection_system" to the end of the list.
2. Insert "load_balancer" at index 2.
After these operations, this part of the exercise expects `network_devices`
to be correctly modified.

USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT:
The system currently has these user accounts: admin, user1, user2, and guest.
For security reasons, the guest account needs to be removed, and two new accounts
(analyst and manager) need to be added.

Create a list named user_accounts with the initial users. Then:
1. Remove "guest" from the list.
2. Add "analyst" and "manager" to the list (e.g., using extend or multiple appends).
This part of the exercise expects `user_accounts` to be correctly modified.
You will also need to create a boolean variable `is_admin_present` that is True
if "admin" is in the `user_accounts` list, and False otherwise.

SECURITY ALERT TRACKING:
Your monitoring system has detected several security incidents that need to be tracked:
- "Failed login attempt from IP address 203.0.113.42"
- "High CPU usage detected on server-01"
- "Suspicious file detected in downloads folder"
- "Firewall rule violation from internal network"

Start with an empty list named security_alerts. Then:
1. Add each of the four incidents to the list.
2. Create a variable `first_alert_removed` and store the first alert by removing it
   from `security_alerts` (e.g., using pop(0)).
This part of the exercise expects `security_alerts` to contain the remaining 3 alerts
and `first_alert_removed` to hold the one that was removed.

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:
Recent vulnerability scans produced these severity scores: 8.5, 6.2, 9.1, 4.3, 7.8.
You need to prioritize remediation efforts by focusing on high-severity vulnerabilities.

Create a list named vulnerability_scores with this data. Then:
1. Sort `vulnerability_scores` in descending order (modifying the list in-place).
2. Create a new list called `high_severity_scores` containing only scores > 7.0
   from the sorted `vulnerability_scores` list (e.g., using a list comprehension).
3. Calculate the average of all scores in the original `vulnerability_scores` list
   and store it in a variable `average_score`. If the list is empty, `average_score`
   should be 0.
This part of the exercise expects `vulnerability_scores` to be sorted,
`high_severity_scores` to contain the filtered scores, and `average_score` to be correct.

SECURITY DASHBOARD SUMMARY (Data Preparation):
For a security dashboard, you need to prepare the following summary data:
- `total_devices`: The total count of network devices.
- `total_users`: The total count of user accounts.
- `active_alerts_count`: The total count of active security alerts.
- `highest_vulnerability_score`: The highest score from `vulnerability_scores`.
  If `vulnerability_scores` is empty, this should be 0.
