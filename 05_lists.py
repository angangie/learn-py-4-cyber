MODULE 5: LISTS - Managing Collections of Security Data üìã
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 5! You've been using lists in previous modules, but now
you'll master them completely. Lists are essential for cybersecurity work
because you're always dealing with collections: IP addresses, user accounts,
security alerts, port numbers, and more.

WHAT ARE LISTS?
Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items. Think of them
as containers that hold related data together, like a list of authorized
users or a collection of suspicious IP addresses.

LIST OPERATIONS WE'LL COVER:
- Creating and accessing lists
- Adding and removing items
- Searching and sorting lists
- List slicing and manipulation
- Common list methods for security work

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Asset Management System
# ============================================================================
"""
SECURITY ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You are building a comprehensive security asset management system for your organization.
The system needs to track network devices, user accounts, security alerts, and
vulnerability assessments. For each task, perform the operations and store the
final results in the specified global variables.

TASK 1: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TRACKING
Initial devices: `network_devices = ["firewall", "router", "switch", "server"]`
Operations:
1. Add "intrusion_detection_system" to the end of `network_devices`.
2. Insert "load_balancer" at index 2 into `network_devices`.
After operations, assign the final state of `network_devices` to `final_network_devices`
and its length to `final_device_count`.

TASK 2: USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
Initial accounts: `user_accounts = ["admin", "user1", "user2", "guest"]`
Operations:
1. Remove "guest" from `user_accounts`.
2. Add "analyst" and "manager" to `user_accounts`.
After operations, assign the final state of `user_accounts` to `final_user_accounts`.
Assign a boolean `("admin" in final_user_accounts)` to `is_admin_in_final_list`.

TASK 3: SECURITY ALERT TRACKING
Initial alerts (strings):
  alert1 = "Failed login attempt from IP address 203.0.113.42"
  alert2 = "High CPU usage detected on server-01"
  alert3 = "Suspicious file detected in downloads folder"
  alert4 = "Firewall rule violation from internal network"
Operations:
1. Create an empty list `security_alerts_log`. Add all four initial alerts to it.
2. Create `formatted_initial_alerts` (list of strings), where each alert from
   `security_alerts_log` is prefixed by its 1-based index (e.g., "1: Failed login...").
3. Remove the first alert from `security_alerts_log`. Store the removed alert string
   in `removed_alert_content`.
4. Create `formatted_remaining_alerts` (list of strings) from the updated
   `security_alerts_log`, again prefixed by 1-based index.

TASK 4: VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
Initial scores: `vulnerability_scores = [8.5, 6.2, 9.1, 4.3, 7.8]`
Operations:
1. Create `sorted_vulnerability_scores` by sorting the `vulnerability_scores` list
   in descending order. (The original list can be modified or a new one created).
2. Create `high_severity_vulns_list` containing scores from `sorted_vulnerability_scores`
   that are > 7.0.
3. Calculate the average of the original `vulnerability_scores` and store it in
   `average_vuln_score`. If the list were empty, average should be 0.0.

TASK 5: SECURITY DASHBOARD SUMMARY DATA
Create these global variables using the final data from the tasks above:
- `dashboard_total_devices`: (int) Value from `final_device_count`.
- `dashboard_total_users`: (int) Length of `final_user_accounts`.
- `dashboard_active_alerts_count`: (int) Length of the updated `security_alerts_log`.
- `dashboard_highest_vulnerability`: (float) The highest score from `sorted_vulnerability_scores`
                                       (or 0.0 if `sorted_vulnerability_scores` is empty).

Outstanding work completing Module 5! Here's what you learned:

‚úÖ Creating and accessing lists with indexing
‚úÖ Adding and removing items with append, insert, remove, pop
‚úÖ Searching lists with 'in' operator and index() method
‚úÖ Sorting lists with sort() and sorted() functions
‚úÖ List slicing for extracting portions of data
‚úÖ List comprehensions for creating filtered lists
‚úÖ How to manage cybersecurity data collections effectively

CYBERSECURITY SKILLS GAINED:
