MODULE 5: LISTS - Managing Collections of Security Data üìã
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 5! You've been using lists in previous modules, but now
you'll master them completely. Lists are essential for cybersecurity work
because you're always dealing with collections: IP addresses, user accounts,
security alerts, port numbers, and more.

WHAT ARE LISTS?
Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items. Think of them
as containers that hold related data together, like a list of authorized
users or a collection of suspicious IP addresses.

LIST OPERATIONS WE'LL COVER:
- Creating and accessing lists
- Adding and removing items
- Searching and sorting lists
- List slicing and manipulation
- Common list methods for security work

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Asset Management System
# ============================================================================
"""
SECURITY ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You are building a comprehensive security asset management system for your organization. 
The system needs to track network devices, user accounts, security alerts, and 
vulnerability assessments.

NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TRACKING:
Your network currently has these devices: firewall, router, switch, and server. 
The security team is adding a new intrusion detection system and needs to insert 
a load balancer between the router and switch (at position 2).

Create a list named network_devices with the initial devices, then add the new 
devices as specified. Report the updated device inventory and total count.

USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT:
The system currently has these user accounts: admin, user1, user2, and guest. 
For security reasons, the guest account needs to be removed, and two new accounts 
(analyst and manager) need to be added.

Create a list named user_accounts, perform the required changes, and verify that 
the admin account exists in the system.

SECURITY ALERT TRACKING:
Your monitoring system has detected several security incidents that need to be tracked:
- Failed login attempt from IP address 203.0.113.42
- High CPU usage detected on server-01
- Suspicious file detected in downloads folder  
- Firewall rule violation from internal network

Start with an empty list named security_alerts, add each incident, then process 
the alerts by displaying them with reference numbers. Remove the first alert 
after it's been addressed and show the updated alert queue.

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:
Recent vulnerability scans produced these severity scores: 8.5, 6.2, 9.1, 4.3, 7.8. 
You need to prioritize remediation efforts by focusing on high-severity vulnerabilities.

Create a list named vulnerability_scores with this data. Sort the scores to identify 
the most critical vulnerabilities, filter for scores above 7.0 (high severity), 
and calculate the average score to understand overall system risk.

SECURITY DASHBOARD SUMMARY:
Generate a comprehensive summary showing the total count of network devices, 
user accounts, active security alerts, and the highest vulnerability score 
to provide management with a quick security overview.
