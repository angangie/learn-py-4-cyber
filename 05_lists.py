MODULE 5: LISTS - Managing Collections of Security Data üìã
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 5! You've been using lists in previous modules, but now
you'll master them completely. Lists are essential for cybersecurity work
because you're always dealing with collections: IP addresses, user accounts,
security alerts, port numbers, and more.

WHAT ARE LISTS?
Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items. Think of them
as containers that hold related data together, like a list of authorized
users or a collection of suspicious IP addresses.

LIST OPERATIONS WE'LL COVER:
- Creating and accessing lists
- Adding and removing items
- Searching and sorting lists
- List slicing and manipulation
- Common list methods for security work

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Asset Management System
# ============================================================================
"""
SECURITY ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You are building a comprehensive security asset management system for your organization.
The system needs to track network devices, user accounts, security alerts, and
vulnerability assessments. You will perform a series of operations and store the
final results in specified variables.

TASK 1: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TRACKING
Initial devices: ["firewall", "router", "switch", "server"]
Operations:
1. Add "intrusion_detection_system" to the end.
2. Insert "load_balancer" at index 2 (to be between "router" and "switch").
Store the final list in `final_network_devices` and its length in `final_device_count`.

TASK 2: USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
Initial accounts: ["admin", "user1", "user2", "guest"]
Operations:
1. Remove "guest".
2. Add "analyst" and "manager" to the list.
Store the final list in `final_user_accounts`.
Create a boolean variable `is_admin_in_final_list` checking if "admin" is present.

TASK 3: SECURITY ALERT TRACKING
Initial alerts (strings):
- "Failed login attempt from IP address 203.0.113.42"
- "High CPU usage detected on server-01"
- "Suspicious file detected in downloads folder"
- "Firewall rule violation from internal network"
Operations:
1. Create an empty list `security_alerts_log`. Add all four initial alerts to it.
2. Create a list `formatted_initial_alerts` where each alert is prefixed by its 1-based index
   (e.g., "1: Failed login...").
3. Remove the first alert from `security_alerts_log` and store its value in `removed_alert_content`.
4. Create `formatted_remaining_alerts` similar to `formatted_initial_alerts` but for the
   updated `security_alerts_log`.

TASK 4: VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
Initial scores: [8.5, 6.2, 9.1, 4.3, 7.8]
Store these in `vulnerability_scores_list`.
Operations:
1. Create `sorted_vulnerability_scores` by sorting `vulnerability_scores_list` in descending order.
   (The original `vulnerability_scores_list` can be modified or a new list created).
2. Create `high_severity_vulns_list` containing scores from `sorted_vulnerability_scores` that are > 7.0.
3. Calculate the average of the original scores and store it in `average_vuln_score`.
   If the list is empty, the average should be 0.0.

TASK 5: SECURITY DASHBOARD SUMMARY DATA
Prepare these variables based on the final states from above tasks:
- `dashboard_total_devices`: (int) from `final_device_count`
- `dashboard_total_users`: (int) length of `final_user_accounts`
- `dashboard_active_alerts`: (int) length of the updated `security_alerts_log` (after removal)
- `dashboard_highest_vulnerability`: (float) the highest score from `sorted_vulnerability_scores`
                                       (or 0.0 if the list was empty).
