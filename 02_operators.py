MODULE 2: OPERATORS - Making Comparisons and Decisions üîç
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 2! Now that you know how to store data in variables,
you'll learn how to work with that data using operators.

WHAT ARE OPERATORS?
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
Think of them as the "action words" of programming - they let you compare,
calculate, and make logical decisions.

TYPES OF OPERATORS WE'LL COVER:
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, / (math operations)
- Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= (comparing values)
- Logical: and, or, not (combining conditions)

CYBERSECURITY APPLICATIONS OF OPERATORS:

1. THRESHOLD MONITORING:
   - Check if CPU usage > 90% (performance monitoring)
   - Verify if failed logins >= 5 (brute force detection)
   - Monitor if network traffic != normal (anomaly detection)

2. SECURITY VALIDATION:
   - Password length >= 8 characters
   - Port number == 443 for secure connections
   - User role != "guest" for admin functions

3. LOGICAL SECURITY DECISIONS:
   - Allow access IF (user authenticated AND permissions granted)
   - Trigger alert IF (intrusion detected OR suspicious activity)
   - Block connection IF NOT (IP whitelisted)

4. SYSTEM STATUS CHECKS:
   - Services running AND patches updated AND firewall enabled
   - Backup completed OR manual backup scheduled
   - NOT vulnerable AND security score > 8.0

5. INCIDENT RESPONSE:
   - Severity == "HIGH" triggers immediate response
   - Multiple failed attempts AND from external IP
   - System compromised OR data breach detected

NETWORK SECURITY CONDITION ANALYZER

You are monitoring a corporate network and need to analyze current security conditions 
to determine if any alerts should be triggered.

Current network status:
- Active connections: 150
- Maximum allowed connections: 100
- Administrator is currently online: Yes
- System is in maintenance mode: No
- Current threat level: 7 (on a scale of 1-10)
- Safe threat threshold: 5

Your system needs to evaluate several security conditions:

1. Determine if the network is experiencing a connection overload
   (when current connections exceed the maximum allowed)

2. Assess if the threat level is high 
   (when threat level exceeds the safe threshold)

3. Check if the system is ready for normal operations
   (when administrator is online AND system is not in maintenance mode)

4. Determine if a security alert should be triggered
   (when there is either a connection overload OR high threat level)

5. Evaluate if it's safe to operate
   (when system is ready AND no security alert is active)

Store these evaluations in variables named connection_overload, threat_high, 
system_ready, security_alert, and safe_to_operate. Also create variables for 
the network status data using names current_connections, max_connections, 
admin_online, maintenance_mode, threat_level, and safe_threshold.

‚úÖ Logical operators for combining conditions (and, or, not)
‚úÖ How to create complex security logic using operators

CYBERSECURITY SKILLS GAINED:
- Monitor system thresholds and limits
- Evaluate security conditions automatically
- Create logical decision-making in scripts
- Build foundation for automated security responses
