MODULE 4: LOOPS - Automating Repetitive Tasks üîÑ
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 4! You've learned to make decisions with conditional
statements. Now you'll learn how to automate repetitive tasks using loops -
one of the most powerful features for cybersecurity automation.

WHAT ARE LOOPS?
Loops let you repeat code multiple times without writing it over and over.
Think of them as "do this task for each item in a list" or "keep doing
this until a condition is met."

TYPES OF LOOPS WE'LL COVER:
- for loops: Repeat code for each item in a sequence
- while loops: Repeat code while a condition is True
- Loop control: break and continue statements
"""

# ============================================================================
# HOW THIS APPLIES TO CYBERSECURITY ADMINISTRATION:
# ============================================================================
"""
CYBERSECURITY APPLICATIONS OF LOOPS:

1. NETWORK SCANNING:
   - FOR each IP in subnet: ping and check if alive
   - FOR each port in common_ports: scan for open services
   - WHILE scanning and not interrupted: continue network discovery

2. LOG FILE ANALYSIS:
   - FOR each line in log_file: analyze for suspicious patterns
   - WHILE reading log entries: count error types and security events
   - FOR each user in access_log: track login patterns

3. SECURITY MONITORING:
   - WHILE system running: monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
   - FOR each running process: check against malware signatures
   - FOR each file in directory: scan for viruses

4. USER MANAGEMENT:
   - FOR each user in database: check last login date
   - FOR each account: verify password expiration status
   - WHILE processing user list: update permissions and roles

5. INCIDENT RESPONSE:
   - FOR each affected system: isolate and analyze
   - WHILE threat active: continue monitoring and containment
   - FOR each security tool: collect logs and evidence

6. AUTOMATED SECURITY TASKS:
   - FOR each server: apply security patches
   - FOR each backup: verify integrity and restore capability
   - WHILE vulnerability scan running: process discovered issues

PRACTICE: Basic For Loop

Write a function `generate_system_checks()` that uses a for loop to generate
a list of strings. For numbers 1 through 3, it should add
"Checking system X" (where X is the number) to the list.
The function should return this list.
Example: ["Checking system 1", "Checking system 2", "Checking system 3"]

PRACTICE: Loop Through List

The function should return a list of strings, where each string is "Security scan X"

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Monitoring System
# ============================================================================
"""
AUTOMATED SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM

You are implementing an automated security monitoring system that performs regular
checks across multiple security domains. The system needs to process lists of data
and perform repetitive security validation tasks.

SECURITY SERVICE MONITORING:
Your organization relies on four critical security services: firewall, antivirus,
backup, and logging. You need to check the status of each service. Based on current
system information, the firewall and antivirus services are running, while the
backup and logging services are stopped.

Create a list named critical_services containing these four service names, then
check the status of each service and report whether it's running or stopped.
This part of the exercise will involve printing the status.

IP ACCESS CONTROL VALIDATION:
Your network has an approved whitelist of IP addresses: 192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1,
and 172.16.0.1. Recent connection attempts came from: 192.168.1.1, 203.0.113.42,
10.0.0.1, 198.51.100.1, and 172.16.0.1.

Create a list named ip_whitelist for approved addresses and connection_attempts
for the recent attempts. Validate each connection attempt against the whitelist
and report whether it should be allowed or blocked by printing the result.

USER LOGIN PATTERN ANALYSIS:
Recent login records show the following user activity: admin, user1, guest, admin,
user2, admin. You need to analyze this data to identify users with high login activity.

Create a list named recent_logins with this data, then count how many times each
user logged in (store this in a dictionary called `login_counts`).
After counting, iterate through `login_counts` and print each user's count.
Flag any user who logged in more than 2 times as having high activity by printing a message.

CONTINUOUS MONITORING CYCLES:
Your monitoring system runs in cycles, alternating between quick security checks
and deep security scans. Simulate 3 monitoring cycles by printing a message for each.
Odd-numbered cycles (1, 3) perform "Quick security check".
Even-numbered cycles (2) perform "Deep security scan".
