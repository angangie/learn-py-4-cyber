MODULE 8: FILE INPUT/OUTPUT - Working with Security Data Files üìÅ
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 8! Functions help you organize code, but cybersecurity work
involves lots of data stored in files: configuration files, log files,
reports, and data exports. You'll learn to read, write, and process files
that are essential for security administration.

WHAT IS FILE I/O?
File Input/Output (I/O) lets your programs interact with files on the system.
In cybersecurity, you constantly work with files: reading configuration files,
parsing log files, generating reports, and storing security data.

FILE I/O CONCEPTS WE'LL COVER:
- Opening and closing files safely
- Reading files: full content, line by line
- Writing files: creating and appending data
- Working with CSV files for structured data
- Processing common cybersecurity file formats

"""
SECURITY FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You are developing a comprehensive file management system for security operations that 
handles user data, security alerts, configuration management, log archiving, and metrics 
reporting. The system must process various file formats and generate actionable security 
intelligence.

USER ACCOUNT DATA PROCESSOR:
Create a function named process_user_list that analyzes user account data from CSV files. 
The system receives user data in CSV format with columns for username, role, email, last 
login date, and account status. Process this data to categorize users as active or inactive, 
identify administrative accounts (users with "admin" or "administrator" roles), and provide 
user statistics for security auditing.

SECURITY ALERT FILTERING SYSTEM:
Create a function named process_security_alerts that processes security incident data. 
The system receives alert data where each line contains timestamp, severity level, source 
system, and description separated by pipe characters. Filter and extract only high-priority 
alerts (those marked as "HIGH" or "CRITICAL" severity) and format them into a readable 
report for incident response teams.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOL:
Create a function named update_security_config that manages security configuration files. 
The system works with configuration files using "key=value" format and must update specific 
settings while preserving existing configurations and comments (lines starting with #). 
The function should safely modify configuration values and maintain file integrity.

LOG ARCHIVE SYSTEM:
Create a function named archive_old_logs that consolidates security logs for long-term 
storage. The system should locate all log files (.log and .txt extensions) in the current 
directory, combine them into a single archive file with proper timestamps and source 
identification, and return a list of successfully archived files.

SECURITY METRICS ANALYZER:
Create a function named generate_metrics_report that produces comprehensive security 
analytics by combining data from multiple sources. Calculate key security metrics including 
user account health ratios, alert volume and severity distributions, and system activity 
levels. Generate a detailed metrics report file and return summary statistics for 
management dashboards.

INTEGRATED TESTING FRAMEWORK:
Implement a complete testing system that creates sample data files representing realistic 
security scenarios: a user database with mixed account types and statuses, security alerts 
with various severity levels, and system configuration files. Test all functions with this 
data and demonstrate the complete file processing workflow.

"""
Outstanding work completing Module 8! Here's what you learned:

‚úÖ Reading files safely with proper file handling
‚úÖ Writing and appending data to files
‚úÖ Processing structured data (CSV, configuration files)
‚úÖ Error handling for file operations
‚úÖ Parsing and analyzing security log files
‚úÖ Working with different file formats and structures
‚úÖ Building comprehensive file management systems

CYBERSECURITY SKILLS GAINED:
- Configuration file management and updates
- Security log analysis and processing
- Alert management and filtering systems
- User account data processing
- Security metrics and reporting
- File archiving and data preservation
- Automated file processing workflows

FINAL MODULE: 09_error_handling.py
In the final module, you'll learn error handling - how to make your
cybersecurity scripts robust, reliable, and capable of handling unexpected
situations gracefully. This is crucial for production security tools!

You're almost ready to build professional cybersecurity automation! üöÄüìä
