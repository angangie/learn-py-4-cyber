MODULE 8: FILE INPUT/OUTPUT - Working with Security Data Files üìÅ
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 8! Functions help you organize code, but cybersecurity work
involves lots of data stored in files: configuration files, log files,
reports, and data exports. You'll learn to read, write, and process files
that are essential for security administration.

WHAT IS FILE I/O?
File Input/Output (I/O) lets your programs interact with files on the system.
In cybersecurity, you constantly work with files: reading configuration files,
parsing log files, generating reports, and storing security data.

FILE I/O CONCEPTS WE'LL COVER:
- Opening and closing files safely
- Reading files: full content, line by line
- Writing files: creating and appending data
- Working with CSV files for structured data
- Processing common cybersecurity file formats

# WARM-UP EXERCISES: Practice File Operations
# ============================================================================

# Exercise 1: Write a simple file
"""
PRACTICE: Recording System Status

Your security system needs to periodically save its current status to a file.
Create a tool (a function) that takes a filename and a status message.
This tool should write the given status message into the specified file.
It should indicate whether the operation was successful.

(Define this as a function `write_status_to_file_warmup(filename, status_message)`
that returns True if writing was successful, False otherwise.)
"""
# TODO: Implement write_status_to_file_warmup
def write_status_to_file_warmup(filename, status_message):
    pass

# Exercise 2: Read a simple file
"""
PRACTICE: Retrieving System Status

Complementary to the previous exercise, you need a tool to read the last saved
system status from a file. This tool should take a filename, attempt to read
its entire content, and return that content. If the file cannot be found or
read, it should return a special value (None) to indicate failure.

(Define this as a function `read_status_from_file_warmup(filename)`
that returns the file content or None.)
"""
# TODO: Implement read_status_from_file_warmup
def read_status_from_file_warmup(filename):
    pass

# Exercise 3: Append to a file
"""
PRACTICE: Continuous Logging

Your system generates log messages that need to be added to an ongoing log file.
Create a utility that takes a filename and a new log message. This utility
should append the new message to the end of the file. To keep the log readable,
if the file isn't empty and doesn't already end with a newline, a newline
should be added before the new message. The utility should report its success.

(Define this as a function `append_log_to_file_warmup(filename, log_message)`
that returns True if appending was successful, False otherwise.)

# Exercise 4: Process file line by line
"""
PRACTICE: Server Checkup from List

You have a list of servers stored in a file, one server name per line.
First, your utility needs to create this server list file from a given string
(where server names in the string are separated by newlines).
Then, it must read this file line by line. For each server name found (ignoring
any empty lines), it should generate a status message "Checking: [server_name]".
Collect all such status messages. If the file, once created, cannot be read,
return an empty collection of messages.

(Define this as a function `get_servers_from_file_warmup(filename, server_list_content_str)`
that returns a list of formatted "Checking: ..." strings.)

# ============================================================================
# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security File Management System
# ============================================================================
"""
CHALLENGE: SECURITY FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You are tasked with developing a suite of tools for managing various security-related
files. Each tool will be a function designed for a specific file operation task.

TOOL 1: USER ACCOUNT DATA PROCESSOR
   Function Name: `process_user_list`
   Input: `csv_filepath` (string path to a CSV file)
   CSV File Format: Each line contains user data: `username,role,email,last_login_date,status`
     (e.g., "jdoe,user,jdoe@example.com,2023-01-15,active")
   Task: Read the CSV file. Parse each line to extract user information.
   Output: Return a dictionary summarizing the data:
     - "total_users": Total number of users in the file.
     - "active_users": A list of usernames for users whose status is "active".
     - "inactive_users": A list of usernames for users whose status is "inactive".
     - "admin_users": A list of usernames for users whose role is "admin" or "administrator" (case-insensitive).
   Error Handling: If the file is not found or a significant parsing error occurs (e.g., incorrect CSV format
                   that prevents basic processing), return `None`.

TOOL 2: SECURITY ALERT FILTERING SYSTEM
   Function Name: `process_security_alerts`
   Inputs: `alerts_filepath` (path to the input alerts file), `output_report_filepath` (path for the filtered report)
   Alerts File Format: Each line is a pipe-separated string: "timestamp|severity|source_system|description"
     (e.g., "2023-10-01T09:30:00Z|HIGH|firewall-01|Suspicious outbound connection")
   Task: Read the alerts file. Identify and filter alerts that are of "HIGH" or "CRITICAL" severity.
         Write these selected high-priority alerts to the `output_report_filepath`. Each alert in the
         output file should be formatted as: "ALERT: [timestamp] - [severity] - [source] - [description]".
   Output: Return the count of high-priority alerts that were processed and written to the report.
   Error Handling: If any file operation fails, return -1.

TOOL 3: CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOL
   Function Name: `update_security_config`
   Inputs: `config_filepath` (path to a configuration file), `updates_dict` (a dictionary like `{"key_to_update": "new_value"}`)
   Config File Format: Standard "key=value" pairs, one per line. Lines starting with "#" are comments and should be preserved.
   Task: Read the existing configuration file. For each key in `updates_dict`:
         - If the key exists in the config file, update its value.
         - If the key does not exist, add it as a new "key=value" pair at the end of the file.
         Preserve all comments and unchanged lines in their original positions. Write the modified
         content back to the `config_filepath`, overwriting the original.
   Output: Return `True` if the update process completes successfully.
   Error Handling: Return `False` if any file operation fails.

TOOL 4: LOG ARCHIVE SYSTEM
   Function Name: `archive_old_logs`
   Inputs: `source_directory` (path to a directory containing log files), `archive_filepath` (path for the consolidated archive file)
   Task: Search `source_directory` for all files ending with ".log" or ".txt". For each found file
         (excluding the `archive_filepath` itself if it's in the same directory):
         1. Get the current timestamp (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS").
         2. Append a header to `archive_filepath`: "--- Start of [filename] (Archived: [timestamp]) ---".
         3. Append the entire content of the found log file to `archive_filepath`.
         4. Append a footer: "--- End of [filename] ---".
         Ensure each appended section (header, content, footer) is followed by a newline in the archive.
   Output: Return a list of filenames that were successfully archived.
   Error Handling: If the `source_directory` doesn't exist or other major file operation errors occur,
                   return an empty list. Individual file read errors should be skipped, and archiving should continue if possible.

TOOL 5: SECURITY METRICS ANALYZER
   Function Name: `generate_metrics_report`
   Inputs: `user_csv_filepath` (for user data), `alerts_input_filepath` (for alert data), `output_metrics_filepath` (for the report)
   Task:
     1. Analyze user data (similar to `process_user_list` or by calling it if available and robust) to get:
        total user count, active user count, and admin user count. Calculate active user percentage.
     2. Analyze the alerts file (similar to `process_security_alerts` but only for counting, not writing a filtered report) to get:
        total alert count, count of "HIGH" or "CRITICAL" alerts, and count of "CRITICAL" alerts only.
     3. Write all these calculated metrics into `output_metrics_filepath` in a human-readable format
        (e.g., "Total Users: 50\nActive User Percentage: 90.0%\n...").
   Output: Return a dictionary containing all the calculated metrics (e.g., `{"total_users": ...,
           "active_user_percentage": ..., "admin_user_count": ..., "total_alerts": ...,
           "high_priority_alert_count": ..., "critical_alert_count": ...}`).
   Error Handling: If essential input files are missing or major processing fails, return an empty dictionary.
