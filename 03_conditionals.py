MODULE 3: CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS - Making Smart Decisions ü§î
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 3! Now that you can compare and evaluate data with operators,
you'll learn how to make your programs take different actions based on those
comparisons using conditional statements.

WHAT ARE CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS?
Conditional statements let your program make decisions. They work like this:
"IF this condition is true, THEN do this action, OTHERWISE do that action."

CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS WE'LL COVER:
- if: Execute code when a condition is True
- elif: Check additional conditions (else if)
- else: Execute code when all conditions are False
"""

# ============================================================================
# HOW THIS APPLIES TO CYBERSECURITY ADMINISTRATION:
# ============================================================================
"""
CYBERSECURITY APPLICATIONS OF CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:

1. ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS:
   - IF user is authenticated AND has proper role THEN grant access
   - IF login attempt from blacklisted IP THEN block immediately
   - IF password strength < minimum THEN require password change

2. INCIDENT RESPONSE AUTOMATION:
   - IF threat level == "CRITICAL" THEN trigger emergency response
   - IF malware detected THEN isolate system AND notify admin
   - IF unusual network activity THEN increase monitoring level

3. SYSTEM MONITORING:
   - IF CPU usage > 90% THEN send alert AND restart service
   - IF disk space < 10% THEN cleanup logs AND notify admin
   - IF service down THEN attempt restart ELSE escalate to admin

4. SECURITY POLICY ENFORCEMENT:
   - IF file extension in dangerous_list THEN quarantine file
   - IF user inactive > 30 days THEN disable account
   - IF unsuccessful logins > 5 THEN lock account for 30 minutes

5. VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT:
   - IF patch level < required THEN schedule update
   - IF security scan finds high vulnerabilities THEN priority fix
   - IF system unpatched > 30 days THEN flag for immediate attention

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Assessment System
# ============================================================================
"""
AUTOMATED SECURITY ASSESSMENT SYSTEM

You are developing an automated security assessment tool that evaluates a computer
system's security posture and provides recommendations.

The system being assessed has the following characteristics:
- Current password length: 6 characters
- Days since last security update: 45 days
- Firewall status: Enabled
- Antivirus status: Not active
- Administrator account status: Active
- Recent failed login attempts: 8 attempts

Your assessment tool needs to evaluate four critical security areas:

PASSWORD SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
Evaluate password strength and provide appropriate feedback:
- Passwords with 12 or more characters are considered strong
- Passwords with 8-11 characters are adequate
- Passwords with less than 8 characters are weak and require immediate change

SYSTEM UPDATE STATUS:
Assess how current the system updates are:
- Systems updated within 7 days are current
- Systems updated within 30 days are acceptable
- Systems not updated for over 30 days are critically outdated

SECURITY SOFTWARE PROTECTION:
Determine the level of security software protection:
- Systems with both firewall and antivirus active are fully protected
- Systems with only one protection active are partially protected
- Systems with neither protection are unprotected

ACCOUNT SECURITY MONITORING:
Analyze login attempt patterns for security threats:
- If admin account is active and failed attempts exceed 5: admin account under attack
- If failed attempts exceed 10: possible brute force attack
- If failed attempts exceed 3: multiple failed attempts warning
- Otherwise: normal login activity

Create variables named password_length, last_update_days, firewall_enabled,
antivirus_active, admin_account_active, and failed_login_attempts to store the
system data, then implement the assessment logic.
"""

# Create password_length variable here

# Create last_update_days variable here

# Create firewall_enabled variable here

# Create antivirus_active variable here

# Create admin_account_active variable here

# Create failed_login_attempts variable here


# TODO: Print system information (Optional, for your own debugging)


# PART 2: Write the conditional statements for the main exercise
# You will need to use the variables created in Part 1 to make decisions.
# For each assessment area, determine the appropriate message based on the rules.
# You can store these messages in variables or print them directly.
