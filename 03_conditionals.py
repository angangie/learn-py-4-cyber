MODULE 3: CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS - Making Smart Decisions ü§î
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 3! Now that you can compare and evaluate data with operators,
you'll learn how to make your programs take different actions based on those
comparisons using conditional statements.

WHAT ARE CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS?
Conditional statements let your program make decisions. They work like this:
"IF this condition is true, THEN do this action, OTHERWISE do that action."

CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS WE'LL COVER:
- if: Execute code when a condition is True
- elif: Check additional conditions (else if)
- else: Execute code when all conditions are False

CYBERSECURITY APPLICATIONS OF CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:

1. ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS:
   - IF user is authenticated AND has proper role THEN grant access
   - IF login attempt from blacklisted IP THEN block immediately
   - IF password strength < minimum THEN require password change

2. INCIDENT RESPONSE AUTOMATION:
   - IF threat level == "CRITICAL" THEN trigger emergency response
   - IF malware detected THEN isolate system AND notify admin
   - IF unusual network activity THEN increase monitoring level

3. SYSTEM MONITORING:
   - IF CPU usage > 90% THEN send alert AND restart service
   - IF disk space < 10% THEN cleanup logs AND notify admin
   - IF service down THEN attempt restart ELSE escalate to admin

4. SECURITY POLICY ENFORCEMENT:
   - IF file extension in dangerous_list THEN quarantine file
   - IF user inactive > 30 days THEN disable account
   - IF unsuccessful logins > 5 THEN lock account for 30 minutes

5. VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT:
   - IF patch level < required THEN schedule update
   - IF security scan finds high vulnerabilities THEN priority fix
   - IF system unpatched > 30 days THEN flag for immediate attention

PRACTICE: Threat Level Assessment

In your security monitoring system, you're tracking a numerical threat level.
For this exercise, assume the current threat level is 8.
Your task is to write code that checks this threat level. If it's above 5,
your system should note "High threat detected". Otherwise, it should note "Low or normal threat".

PRACTICE: Port Connection Type

Your system needs to identify the type of connection based on a port number.
Consider port number 22. If the connection is on port 22, it's an "SSH connection".
Any other port should be identified as "Other connection".

PRACTICE: Security Score Evaluation

A system's security posture is rated with a score. For this scenario, the score is 7.

Determine if the system is "System ready for operations" or "System not ready".

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Assessment System
# ============================================================================
"""
CHALLENGE: AUTOMATED SECURITY ASSESSMENT TOOL

Imagine you're building a tool to quickly assess a computer's security settings.
This tool will check several aspects of the system and report on each.

First, establish the current state of the system by defining these characteristics:
- The password for the main user account is 6 characters long.
- The system was last updated 45 days ago.
- The firewall is currently enabled.
- Antivirus software is not active.
- The primary administrator account is active.
- There have been 8 failed login attempts recently.

Based on these characteristics, your tool needs to generate specific assessment messages
for different security areas. The rules for these messages are as follows:

1.  PASSWORD SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
    How strong is the password?
    - If the password length is 12 characters or more, it's a "Strong password".
    - If it's between 8 and 11 characters (inclusive), it's an "Adequate password".
    - If it's shorter than 8 characters, it's a "Weak password, requires immediate change".
    (Store this assessment in `password_assessment_msg`.)

2.  SYSTEM UPDATE STATUS:
    Is the system up-to-date?
    - If the last update was 7 days ago or less, "System updates are current".
    - If it was between 8 and 30 days ago (inclusive of 30), "System updates are acceptable".
    - If it was more than 30 days ago, "System is critically outdated".
    (Store this status in `update_status_msg`.)

3.  SECURITY SOFTWARE PROTECTION:
    How well is the system protected by security software?
    - If both the firewall is enabled AND antivirus is active, "System is fully protected".
    - If either the firewall is enabled OR antivirus is active (but not both), "System is partially protected".
    - If neither is active, "System is unprotected".
    (Store this protection status in `software_protection_msg`.)

4.  ACCOUNT SECURITY MONITORING:
    What's the status of account login activity? (Evaluate these conditions in order)
    - If the admin account is active AND there have been more than 5 failed login attempts, it's an "Admin account under attack".
    - Else, if there have been more than 10 failed login attempts, it's a "Possible brute force attack".
    - Else, if there have been more than 3 failed login attempts, it's a "Multiple failed attempts warning".
    - Otherwise, it's "Normal login activity".
    (Store this activity status in `account_security_msg`.)

OPTIONAL CHALLENGE: OVERALL SECURITY RECOMMENDATION
    Based on the individual assessment messages you've generated, try to determine an
    overall security recommendation. For example:
    - If multiple areas are weak or critical, the recommendation might be "Urgent action required across multiple areas."
    - If most areas are good, "System posture is fair, address noted issues."
    - If all areas are strong, "System security posture is strong."
    This is an open-ended part for you to define your own logic.
    (Store your overall recommendation in `overall_recommendation_msg`.)

Your goal is to implement the logic to define the initial characteristics and then
determine each of these messages, storing them in their respective global variables for automated checking.
