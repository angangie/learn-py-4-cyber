Welcome to the final module! You've learned all the core Python concepts.
Now you'll master error handling - the critical skill that makes your
cybersecurity tools robust, reliable, and ready for real-world deployment.

WHAT IS ERROR HANDLING?
Error handling lets your programs gracefully manage unexpected situations:
network failures, missing files, invalid data, or system errors. In
cybersecurity, robust error handling is essential because your tools must
work reliably even when systems are under attack or compromised.

ERROR HANDLING CONCEPTS WE'LL COVER:
- Understanding different types of errors
- try/except blocks for catching errors
- Multiple exception types and specific handling
- finally blocks for cleanup operations
- Custom exceptions for security scenarios
- Best practices for robust cybersecurity tools

# WARM-UP EXERCISES: Practice Error Handling
# ============================================================================

# Exercise 1: Basic try-except
"""
PRACTICE: Safe Integer Conversion

Your system often receives data as strings that need to be converted to numbers.
Create a tool that attempts to convert a given string value into an integer.
If the conversion is successful, the tool should provide the integer.
However, if the string cannot be converted (e.g., it's "abc"), the tool
should report "Invalid number" instead of crashing.

(Define this as a function `safe_convert_to_int_warmup(value_str)` that
returns the integer or the error string.)

# Exercise 2: Handle file not found
"""
PRACTICE: Robust Configuration File Reading

Security tools often rely on configuration files. It's important that your
tools can handle situations where a configuration file might be missing.
Develop a utility that tries to open and read a specified configuration file.
If the file exists and is readable, it should return the file's content.
If the file is not found, it should indicate this by returning "File not found".

(Define this as a function `read_config_file_warmup(filename)` that
returns the file content or the error string.)

def read_config_file_warmup(filename):

# Exercise 3: Multiple exception types

PRACTICE: Secure Division Calculator

You're building a calculator for security metrics that involves division.
This calculator must be robust and handle various mathematical errors gracefully.
It should take two numbers, `a` and `b`, and attempt to calculate `a / b`.
- If division by zero is attempted, it should return "Cannot divide by zero".
- If the inputs are not valid numbers for division (e.g., one is a string),
  it should return "Invalid input types".
- For any other unexpected error during division, it should return "An unexpected error occurred".

(Define this as a function `safe_divide_warmup(a, b)` that returns the
result or an appropriate error message string.)

# Exercise 4: Try-except-finally
"""
PRACTICE: File Processing with Guaranteed Cleanup

When processing files, especially in security contexts, it's often crucial
to ensure that certain cleanup actions (like logging the completion of an operation)
are performed, regardless of whether the main file operation succeeded or failed.
Create a tool that attempts to read a given file and return its content.
Whether the read is successful or fails (e.g., file not found), this tool
MUST always write a message "File operation completed for [filename]" to
a separate log file named "cleanup_log.txt". If reading the original file fails,
the tool should return `None` for the content.

(Define this as a function `process_file_with_cleanup_warmup(filename)` that
returns the file content or None, and always attempts the cleanup logging.)

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Robust Security Monitoring System
# ============================================================================
"""
CHALLENGE: ROBUST SECURITY MONITORING SYSTEM

You are tasked with developing a sophisticated security monitoring system.
This system must be highly resilient, capable of handling various errors
gracefully, and providing clear feedback on its operations.

COMPONENT 1: CUSTOM SECURITY EXCEPTION FRAMEWORK
   Define a hierarchy of custom exceptions to represent specific security-related
   error conditions. All these exceptions should ultimately inherit from a base
   `SecurityException` (which itself inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`).
   The specific exceptions to define are:
   - `NetworkSecurityError`: For issues related to network connectivity or security.
   - `DataValidationError`: For problems with the format or content of security data.
   - `ConfigurationError`: For errors encountered in system or tool configurations.
   - `SecurityPolicyError`: For violations of established security policies.

COMPONENT 2: SECURE FILE PROCESSING ENGINE
   Create a function `secure_file_processor(filename, operation_type)` for robustly
   handling file operations. `operation_type` can be "read", "parse", or "validate".
   - "read": Attempt to read and return the entire content of `filename`.
   - "parse": Assume `filename` contains "key=value" pairs per line (comments with "#"
              and empty lines should be ignored). Return a list of dictionaries,
              e.g., `[{"key": "firewall", "value": "enabled"}]`. If a line is
              not a comment/empty and not in "key=value" format, raise `DataValidationError`.
   - "validate": Check if the file content is empty or contains the exact string "CRITICAL".
                 Return `True` if the content is valid (not empty and no "CRITICAL" string).
                 Raise `DataValidationError` if it's empty or "CRITICAL" is found.
   Error Handling for `secure_file_processor`:
     - If the file is not found, raise `FileNotFoundError`.
     - If permissions deny access, raise `PermissionError`.
     - Wrap any other `IOError` during file operations in a `ConfigurationError`.
   Logging: For every operation (attempt, success, or failure), append a detailed message
            to "security_operations.log". The log entry should include a timestamp,
            log level (INFO/ERROR), the operation type, filename, and success/error details.
   Return Value: A dictionary `{"success": True/False, "data": ..., "error": "message if failed"}`.
                 `data` is the file content for "read", list of dicts for "parse", or boolean for "validate".
                 The "error" field should contain a descriptive message if `success` is `False`.

COMPONENT 3: NETWORK SECURITY MONITORING SERVICE
   Implement `monitor_network_security(ip_list, port_list)` to simulate checking network targets.
   For each IP address and port combination:
     - If `ip_list` contains "0.0.0.0", immediately raise `NetworkSecurityError`
       ("Monitoring all interfaces is a risk"). This check applies to the whole list.
     - If a port number is outside the valid range (1-65535), raise `DataValidationError`.
     - Simulate the check: randomly determine if the port is "open", "closed", or if a "timeout" occurs.
     - If a "timeout" occurs for a specific IP/port, raise `NetworkSecurityError("Connection timeout")`.
   The function should continue checking other IP/port pairs even if one check fails due to
   a `DataValidationError` or `NetworkSecurityError` specific to that pair.
   Return: A list of dictionaries for successfully checked pairs: `{"ip": ..., "port": ..., "status": "open/closed"}`.

COMPONENT 4: SECURITY CONFIGURATION VALIDATOR
   Create `validate_security_config(config_dict)` to check a parsed configuration (dictionary).
   Validations:
     - It must contain "firewall_enabled" and "max_login_attempts" keys. If not, raise `ConfigurationError`.
     - The value for "firewall_enabled" must be `True`. If not, raise `SecurityPolicyError`.
     - "max_login_attempts" must be an integer between 3 and 10 (inclusive). If not, raise `DataValidationError`.
   Return: `True` if all validations pass. (The function will raise an exception otherwise).

COMPONENT 5: INTEGRATED SECURITY DASHBOARD (Class)
   Develop a `SecurityDashboard` class.
   - `__init__(self, name)`: Store `name`. Initialize `successful_ops = 0`, `failed_ops = 0`,
     and `error_log = []` (a list to store string representations of errors).
   - `_log_error(self, operation_name, error_instance)`: A helper to append a formatted error string
     (e.g., "[operation_name] failed: [ExceptionType] - [error_message]") to `self.error_log`
     and increment `failed_ops`.
   - `process_file_batch(self, filenames_ops_tuples)`: Takes a list of `(filename, op_type)` tuples.
     Calls `secure_file_processor` for each. If `result["success"]` is True, increment `successful_ops`.
     Otherwise, call `_log_error` with details from `result["error"]`. Return a list of all results
     from `secure_file_processor`.
   - `run_network_checks(self, ips, ports)`: Calls `monitor_network_security`. If `monitor_network_security`
     itself raises `NetworkSecurityError` (e.g., for "0.0.0.0") or any other exception not caught internally by it,
     call `_log_error`. If it completes (even if some individual IP/port checks failed internally and were skipped),
     increment `successful_ops`. Return the list of results from `monitor_network_security` or `None` if a
     function-level exception was caught by `run_network_checks`.
   - `audit_configurations(self, config_dicts_map)`: Takes a dictionary `{"configname": config_dict}`.
     Calls `validate_security_config` for each. If validation is successful (returns True), increment `successful_ops`.
     If `validate_security_config` raises any of the defined custom exceptions or `DataValidationError`,
     call `_log_error`. Return a dictionary `{"configname": True/False (validation_status)}`.
   - `get_dashboard_summary(self)`: Returns a multi-line string summarizing total operations,
     successful ops, failed ops, and lists all errors from `self.error_log`.

COMPONENT 6: COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TESTING (Illustrative Function)
   Create `run_security_monitoring_test()` to demonstrate the system.
   - Prepare sample files: "valid_read.txt", "valid_parse.ini" (key=value format),
     "invalid_parse.ini" (malformed line), "critical_content.txt" (contains "CRITICAL"),
     "empty_file.txt".
   - Instantiate `SecurityDashboard`.
   - Execute dashboard methods using a mix of valid and invalid inputs designed to trigger
     both successful operations and various error conditions (e.g., try to process a
     non-existent file, parse an invalid file, validate a file with "CRITICAL" content).
   - Run network checks with valid IPs, an invalid port, and potentially the "0.0.0.0" case.
   - Audit configurations: one valid, one missing required keys, one violating a policy.
   - Print the summary from `get_dashboard_summary()`.
   - Verify that "security_operations.log" has been created and contains entries.
   (This function is for demonstration and its internal prints will show the system's behavior.)

This comprehensive exercise will test your ability to design error-handling strategies,
use try-except-finally blocks, define custom exceptions, and build a resilient application.
